  ## Description

  In this project, we were to create a weather dashboard, utilizing the Open Weather API, so that a user can check the weather of any particular city they wished, not just for that day, but for the following five days, also. Html, CSS, and Javascript (with jQuery) were also used to create this, along with utilizing local storage, to keep track of the users cities they have searched. It features a submit form for the user to select their city of choice, along with a clear history button to clear the city buttons field, info fields, as well as, the local storage. This was one of my favorite projects to work on so far, and it was fairly easy to figure out. I did have some issues with getting the UV Index and Five Day Forecast API calls to work, but that was more so misunderstanding on my part.

  ## Installation

  No installation necessary.  The application is deployed on Github and may be accessed by clicking the following link: https://kjknudtson.github.io/Weather_Dashboard/

  ## Usage

  When the user opens the program, they will see an input form, along with a blue "submit" button and red "clear history" button, to the left. The user may type the name of any city they wish, into the input line and then click the submit button. Once doing so, a blue button will appear below with the name of the entered city on it. Once the user clicks the button, information regarding the day's forecast will appear in the upper right gray box, and a five day forecast for that same city will appear in the lower right gray box. The user will see that the UV Index will appear in a different color, depending on the severity, ranging from green (low), to red (severe). THe user may add any city through the form, and if the user no longer wishes to keep those cities, they may click the clear history button, which will remove all of the city buttons from the panel.
